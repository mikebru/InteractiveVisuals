# About
Note that both processes FREEZE touchdesigner while
the gif is being created. I would recommend eventually
breaking this project into two pieces. One piece will be the main
project and it won't freeze. The second project will
receive an instruction from the first project to execute
the ffmpeg gif encoding as a subprocess, and then it will
start that subprocess (causing a freeze).
