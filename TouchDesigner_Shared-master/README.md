This repository contains TouchDesigner files that I've created and files that I've modified from the Derivative forums. I'll accept pull requests and bug reports. Please note the GNU General Public License v3.0.

You can find demos of a few of these files on my [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/davidbraun) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkDwJxKzQocvGhQOCTQi70w) pages.
