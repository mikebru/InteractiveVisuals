touchMixerII is a live visual performance tool made with TouchDesigner 088.

Features:
- 2 Channel tox Bank and Mixer
You can stock up to 256 tox components (TouchDesigner projects) in the bank and smoothly load it in realtime. Optimized implementation with procedural Python script and Replicator COMP. 

- Simple File System
You can select your root folder which can have 8 subfolder inside it. Each subfolder will appear as a tab on the bank. A tab(folder) can contain 32 tox files. Sample root folder "tox" is inclueded in the zip.

- Practical Audio Input
is available for audio reactive composition. You can control incoming signal with a Band EQ and Parametric EQ.

- Parameter Auto-Assign Function
You can reserve up to 8 visual control parameters in each of your TouchDesigner project and the parameters will be automatically assigned to the control section.

- Output Management  
You can define master resolution and each project will follow the resolution when you load it from the bank. Also basic tranform and scale are supported.

- Selected Visual Effects
Simple but useful.

- Selected Composite Operators
Based on the "Blend" component in TouchDesigner's Palette Browser. But much tidy and optimized.

- Flexible MIDI Input
You can activate/deactivate parameters dynamically. KORG nanoKONTROL2's sample MIDI map file is included.

* To use all these features, you have to follow some rule's when you make your TD project. You can find the rule inside the template tox file. It's simple.
